# Business Card & Email Signature Project

This project is created to demonstrate how to create the business card and the email signature using the following technologies: 
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- QRCode.js 
- vCard
- html2canvas.js

### QRCode.js
QRCode.js is javascript library for making QRCode. QRCode.js supports Cross-browser with HTML5 Canvas and table tag in DOM. QRCode.js has no dependencies.

- Used in the `Business Card` to make a Unique QRCode from the information submitted by the user in the form.

- If you scan this QR in your phone it will open my contact information and you can save it easily. [Example](#vcard)
